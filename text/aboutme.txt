I am a freelancer fine arts student majoring in sculpture. I enjoy doing illustrations, sculpting and creating 3D models. I can make 3D models consisting of many elements, such as accessories and different materials. I can do organic modeling and hard surface modeling. What motivates me most is producing satisfactory results that exceed the needs of my clients. I seek to learn new tools and skills that support my foundation.
